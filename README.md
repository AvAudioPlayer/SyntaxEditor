SyntaxEditor
============

Syntax oriented editor, not another stupid text editor.

This application is under heavy developping. There is a list below to help you understand what we are doing and what we are going to do.

* We are going to build a general syntax oriented editor that allow you to do editing on AST level.
* The JavaScript language has been selected as the first language to implement because it's widely used. But we will add more language later.
* Implementing an editor is the final goal, before that we will forcus on implementing an visually souce code analyzer: the Î»-VIEW
